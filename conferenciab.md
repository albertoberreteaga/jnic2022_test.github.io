## Conferencia Invitada - Combating the Internet of Evil Things: detecting, profiling and mitigating IoT-based attacks
### por Carlos H. Gañan

Despite the benefits of the widespread deployment of diverse Internet-enabled devices such as IP cameras and smart home appliances - the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) has amplified the attack surface that is being leveraged by cyber criminals. While manufacturers keep deploying new products, infected devices can be counted in the millions and spreading at an alarming rate all over consumer and business networks. How can we detect these infections? Who is responsible for this problem? How can we deploy effective countermeasures?
